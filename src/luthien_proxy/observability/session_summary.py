"""Incremental maintenance of the ``session_summaries`` materialized table.

``session_summaries`` denormalizes per-session aggregates (counts, models used,
a preview message, attributed user_id) so the history list page does not have
to re-aggregate ``conversation_events`` on every load.

It is updated *incrementally* from the per-event write path in
:mod:`luthien_proxy.observability.emitter` — one upsert per event — rather than
by a batched drain loop. That keeps the maintenance coupled to the existing
event-write transaction and avoids depending on the (separate) bounded
EventEmitter rework.

The SQL here is written to run unchanged on both Postgres and SQLite: the
SQLite connection wrapper translates ``$N`` placeholders and strips ``::``
casts, and ``ON CONFLICT ... DO UPDATE`` / ``COALESCE`` / ``MIN`` / ``MAX`` are
common to both backends.
