class SessionSearchParams(BaseModel):
    """Optional server-side filters for the session list endpoint.

    All fields default to "no filter". When several are set they combine with
    AND. A session is the unit of matching: model/q ask "does any event in this
    session match?", while the time and intervention filters operate on
    session-level aggregates.

    Semantics:
      - model: session used this exact ``final_model`` in at least one turn.
      - from_time / to_time: the session's *last activity* (the max event
        timestamp) falls within ``[from_time, to_time]``, inclusive. Either
        bound may be omitted. (Last-activity, not overlap — consistent with the
        list's ``ORDER BY last_ts``.) Bounds are interpreted as UTC: a
        timezone-aware value is converted to UTC and a naive value is taken
        as-is (see the validator below). When ``user_id`` is also set, "last
        activity" is scoped to *that user's* events in the session, not the
        session's last activity overall.
      - q: full-text content search over indexed conversation text. Postgres
        uses the ``search_vector`` tsvector column; SQLite uses the
        ``conversation_events_fts`` FTS5 table. Both are porter-stemmed and
        treat the query as a conjunction of terms (see ``utils.search``). A
        session matches if any of its events matches.
      - policy_intervention: when True, restrict to sessions with at least one
        policy intervention.

    Known limitation (tracked separately): the search corpus is built from
    ``final_request`` text, which includes gateway-injected ``<policy-context>``
    blocks. Queries for policy-context terms can therefore over-match on
    sessions that ran under an output-modifying policy.
