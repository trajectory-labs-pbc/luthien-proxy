"""Dispatch an `InferenceProviderRef` to a concrete provider + credential_override.

Judge policies declare an `inference_provider:` YAML field that parses to one
of three tagged shapes (`UserCredentials` / `Provider(name)` /
`UserThenProvider(name, on_fallback)`). At request time the policy calls
`resolve_inference_provider(ref, context, registry)` and gets back a ready
(provider, credential_override) pair to pass to `provider.complete()`.

Design notes:

- `UserCredentials`: the request must carry a user credential (set by the
  gateway's auth pipeline onto `PolicyContext.user_credential`). We return
  a passthrough provider (built fresh per call) plus the user credential
  as override. A passthrough provider is a plain `DirectApiProvider`
  configured with a placeholder credential; the override is the only
  credential it actually uses.
- `Provider(name)`: look the provider up in the registry. The registry
  returns a freshly-built instance with its credential already resolved,
  so we return it with `credential_override=None`.
- `UserThenProvider(name, on_fallback)`: if the request has a user cred,
  same as `UserCredentials`. If not, the `on_fallback` mode decides whether
  to reject the request, log+fallback, or silently fallback — all three
  fallbacks reach for the same registry lookup as `Provider(name)`.

The passthrough provider is built with a `default_model` matching the
caller's configured judge model because `DirectApiProvider.complete()` uses
the caller-supplied model when present; the default only matters if
`complete(model=None)` is called.
