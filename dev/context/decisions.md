# Technical Decisions

Why certain approaches were chosen over alternatives.

**Format**: Each entry is a subsection with a title, timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD), and content (decision + rationale).

## Auto-Release on Merge to Main (2026-04-09)

**Decision**: Fully automated patch releases on every merge to main. Replaces the previous manual tag-based workflow (2026-03-18). See `dev-README.md` § Releasing for the full procedure.

**How it works**: `auto-tag-proxy.yml` fires on push to main, compiles `changelog.d/` fragments, cuts a versioned `CHANGELOG.md` section, commits it back (with `[skip auto-tag-proxy]` to prevent loops), and tags `vX.Y.Z`. Downstream workflows (`release.yml`, `docker-publish.yml`) handle GitHub Releases and Docker images. Minor/major bumps are manual (just create the tag).

**CHANGELOG enforcement**: Unchanged — non-blocking reminder on PRs missing a `changelog.d/` fragment. PRs labeled `skip-changelog` or `chore` skip the check.

**Rationale**:
- **Why auto-release on merge**: The manual process produced 72 uncompiled fragments over months. Manual = never.
- **Why patch-only auto-bumps**: Simplicity. Minor/major bumps are intentional decisions that shouldn't be automated.
- **Why rebase instead of skip on concurrent merges**: Successive merges would silently lose tags if the verify step just skipped. Rebase handles the common case; conflicts fail loudly.

## Integrated Gateway (2025-10-24)

**Decision**: Replace the previous two-process architecture (a separate LiteLLM proxy plus a control-plane service) with a single integrated gateway.

**Rationale**:
- **Simpler deployment**: One service instead of two, easier to reason about
- **Better performance**: No network hop between proxy and control plane
- **Cleaner code**: Direct function calls instead of HTTP callbacks
- **Easier testing**: Single process to start/stop, no inter-service coordination

**Trade-offs accepted**:
- Lost separation of concerns (but gained simplicity)
- Single process means single point of failure (but easier to monitor/restart)

## Event-Driven Policy DSL (2025-10-24)

**Decision**: Use lifecycle hooks (on_chunk_started, on_content_chunk, etc.) instead of callbacks.

**Rationale**:
- **Stream-aware**: Policies can buffer, transform, or block streaming responses
- **Cleaner interface**: Explicit hooks for different event types
- **Better composition**: Easier to layer policies or implement middleware patterns
- **Type safety**: Strongly typed parameters for each hook

**Example policies**: NoOpPolicy, UppercaseNthWord, ToolCallJudgeV3

## Configuration: POLICY_CONFIG (2025-10-24)

**Decision**: Use `POLICY_CONFIG` environment variable pointing to YAML file for policy configuration.

**Rationale**:
- Load policy class dynamically without code changes
- Support different policies per environment (dev/staging/prod)
- Simple YAML format: `policy.class` and `policy.config` sections

**Example**:
```yaml
policy:
  class: "luthien_proxy.policies.tool_call_judge_v3:ToolCallJudgeV3Policy"
  config:
    model: "your-model"
    api_base: "http://your-llm-server:port"
```

## Conversation Storage (2025-10-24)

**Decision**: Use `conversation_calls` and `conversation_events` tables for request/response persistence.

**Rationale**:
- **Structured storage**: SQL-queryable request/response pairs
- **Background queue**: Non-blocking persistence via `SequentialTaskQueue`
- **Complete payloads**: Store full OpenAI-format request/response, not streaming chunks
- **Streaming handled separately**: Chunks only for live monitoring (Redis) and debugging (debug_logs)

**Schema**:
- `conversation_calls`: call_id, model_name, status, timestamps
- `conversation_events`: call_id, event_type (request|response), sequence, payload (jsonb)

## OpenTelemetry for Observability (2025-10-24)

**Decision**: Use OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing and log correlation.

**Rationale**:
- **Industry standard**: Works with Grafana Tempo, Jaeger, etc.
- **Automatic instrumentation**: FastAPI + httpx already traced
- **Custom spans**: Add luthien-specific attributes (call_id, policy decisions, chunk counts)
- **Log correlation**: Inject trace_id/span_id into all log messages
- **Optional**: Can run V2 without observability stack (degrades gracefully)

**Stack**: Tempo (distributed tracing via OTLP)

## Platform Vision (2025-10-24)

**Decision**: Build general-purpose infrastructure for LLM policy enforcement.

**Rationale**: Support both simple policies (rate limiting, content filtering) and complex adversarially robust policies (AI Control methodology).

The V2 architecture supports this range:
- Event-driven policies allow complex streaming transformations
- Policy context for per-request state management
- OpenTelemetry for deep observability of policy decisions
- Reference implementations from simple (NoOp) to complex (ToolCallJudge)

This is infrastructure-first: AI Control is an important use case, not the defining architecture.

## Streaming Pipeline: Queue-Based Architecture (2025-11-05, superseded 2026-04-10)

**Historical only.** This entry described a short-lived two-stage queue pipeline (`PolicyExecutor` → `Queue[ModelResponse]` → `ClientFormatter` → `Queue[str]`) built around LiteLLM's `ModelResponse` type. That design was removed when the gateway moved to direct Anthropic SDK usage. The current Anthropic streaming path lives in `src/luthien_proxy/pipeline/anthropic_processor.py` and uses `AnthropicClient` + `AnthropicExecutionInterface`; there is no `orchestration/` or `streaming/` package. Read the processor module for the up-to-date flow.

## Context Threading Pattern (2025-11-05)

**Decision**: Create `ObservabilityContext` and `PolicyContext` at gateway, thread through entire request/response lifecycle.

**Rationale**:
- **Consistent observability**: Trace ID and span context available throughout pipeline
- **Policy state management**: PolicyContext.scratchpad allows stateful policy logic
- **Clear ownership**: Gateway owns context lifecycle, components just use it
- **Prevents globals**: Explicit context passing instead of thread-locals or globals

**Pattern**:
```python
# Gateway creates contexts
obs_ctx = ObservabilityContext(...)
policy_ctx = PolicyContext(transaction_id=call_id)

# Pass to orchestrator
orchestrator.process_request(request, obs_ctx, policy_ctx)
orchestrator.process_streaming_response(stream, obs_ctx, policy_ctx)
```

**Key separation**: ObservabilityContext is immutable (tracing), PolicyContext is mutable (scratchpad for policy state).

## Observability Strategy: Custom ObservabilityContext (2025-11-18)

**Decision**: Keep custom `ObservabilityContext` abstraction for multi-destination event emission, but simplify and clarify the architecture.

**Current architecture**:
- **Layer 1 (Application)**: Code calls `obs_ctx.record(PipelineRecord(...))` or `logger.info()`
- **Layer 2 (ObservabilityContext)**: Routes events to multiple sinks (PostgreSQL, Redis, OTel)
- **Layer 3 (Sinks)**: Write to specific destinations (never called directly from app code)

**Key principles**:
1. **Sinks should be configurable** - Not hardcoded to "send to all 4 sinks", make routing configurable per environment
2. **Don't wrap OTel** - Expose span directly (`obs_ctx.span.set_attribute()`) rather than wrapping OTel's API
3. **Structured events via LuthienRecord** - Standard format for business events (e.g., `PipelineRecord`)
4. **Regular logs via Python logging** - Operational logs use standard `logger.info/warning/error`

**Rationale**:
- Custom solution justified: Multi-destination requirement, transaction context threading, typed structured records
- Close to a clean solution: ObservabilityContext is lightweight facade, not heavy abstraction
- Alternative considered: `structlog` with custom processors - would reduce maintenance burden but requires migration
- Decision: Keep custom approach for now, revisit `structlog` if complexity grows

**Next steps** (deferred):
- Make sinks configurable (env-based: dev uses fewer sinks than prod)
- Consider `structlog` migration if observability logic becomes harder to maintain

---

## Dependency Injection for EventEmitter (2025-12-05)

**Decision**: Remove global EventEmitter and inject via `Dependencies` container and `PolicyContext`.

**Rationale**: Functions that emit events should declare that dependency explicitly. This matches how Redis/DB/LLM are already injected, makes tests simpler (inject `NullEventEmitter` instead of mocking globals), and eliminates hidden side effects.

---

## Anthropic Streaming Event Types: TypedDicts vs SDK Types (2026-02-03)

**Decision**: Define our own TypedDicts for Anthropic streaming events rather than using the Anthropic SDK's Pydantic types.

**Options considered**:
1. **TypedDicts (own definitions)**: Flexible for JSON manipulation, matches existing codebase pattern
2. **Anthropic SDK Pydantic types**: Already tested, always up-to-date with SDK

**Rationale**:
- **Consistency**: The existing `anthropic.py` already uses TypedDicts for requests/responses and content blocks. Streaming events are just different wrappers around the same content blocks.
- **Flexibility**: TypedDicts work naturally with `json.dumps()` and dict manipulation. The streaming code creates dicts inline - TypedDicts provide type safety without changing the code patterns.
- **Simplicity**: We only need the core event types we actually emit. The SDK types include citations, web search results, and many optional fields we never use.
- **No runtime cost**: TypedDicts are purely for type checking, no Pydantic validation overhead.

**Types added**:
- `AnthropicMessageStartEvent`, `AnthropicMessageStopEvent`
- `AnthropicContentBlockStartEvent`, `AnthropicContentBlockDeltaEvent`, `AnthropicContentBlockStopEvent`
- `AnthropicMessageDeltaEvent`
- Delta types: `AnthropicTextDelta`, `AnthropicThinkingDelta`, `AnthropicInputJSONDelta`, `AnthropicSignatureDelta`
- Union types: `AnthropicStreamingEvent`, `AnthropicStreamingContentBlock`, `AnthropicStreamingDelta`

## Documentation Split: Public vs Private Repos (2026-02-04)

**Decision**: Keep technical implementation docs in public `luthien-proxy` repo; move planning, strategy, and user stories to private `luthien-org` repo.

**What stays in luthien-proxy (public)**:
- Architecture docs (`ARCHITECTURE.md`, `dev/context/request_processing.md`)
- Context files (`dev/context/gotchas.md`, `decisions.md`, `codebase_learnings.md`, `otel-conventions.md`)
- Active tracking: gitignored scratch at `dev/scratch/` (OBJECTIVE/NOTES); TODOs tracked on [Trello](https://trello.com/b/ehoxykPf/luthien?filter=label:luthien-proxy%20TODO)
- CHANGELOG.md

**What goes in luthien-org (private)**:
- User stories and product roadmap
- UI/UX specs and mockups
- Historical planning docs (archived)
- Competitive research

**Rationale**:
- **Signal-to-noise**: Public repo should help contributors understand the codebase, not internal planning
- **Industry norm**: Many OSS projects (e.g., LiteLLM) keep planning in GitHub Issues/Projects rather than in-repo docs
- **Focus**: Developers cloning the repo need implementation context, not product strategy

## Typed Request State Slots for Policies (2026-02-27, Retired 2026-02-27)

**Decision (retired)**: Initially added `StateSlot[T]` + `PolicyContext.get_state()/pop_state()` for request-scoped mutable policy state.

**Rationale**:
- **Stateless policy instances**: Keep mutable streaming state off policy objects.
- **Strict typing**: State is stored as typed dataclasses (`T`) with runtime type checks on retrieval.
- **Consistent lifecycle**: Works for both OpenAI and Anthropic paths using the existing per-request `PolicyContext`.
- **Predictable cleanup**: Policies clear request state in completion hooks.

**Applied in**:
- `SimplePolicy` Anthropic buffering state
- `ToolCallJudgePolicy` OpenAI + Anthropic streaming buffering/blocking state

---

## Policy Config Validation Guardrail (2026-02-27, Revised 2026-02-27)

**Decision**: Use a lightweight load-time validation guardrail rather than runtime instance freezing.

**Mechanics**:
- `_instantiate_policy(...)` calls `BasePolicy.freeze_configured_state()` after construction.
- `freeze_configured_state()` validates public attrs and rejects mutable containers (`dict`/`list`/`set`/etc.).
- Runtime attribute assignment is not blocked.

**Rationale**:
- Catches obvious config-shape mistakes without forcing invasive code patterns.
- Avoids per-class escape-hatch complexity for composite policies.
- Keeps request-scoped mutable data directed into `PolicyContext` state APIs.

---

## Framework-Owned Policy State API (2026-02-27)

**Decision**: Use framework-owned policy state via `PolicyContext.get_request_state()/pop_request_state()` and remove legacy slot APIs.

**Mechanics**:
- State is keyed by `(policy instance, expected state type)` inside `PolicyContext`.
- Policies provide only `expected_type` + `factory`; they do not own slot keys.
- Runtime type checks remain enforced on create/get/pop paths.
- Legacy `StateSlot` / `get_state` / `pop_state` removed from `policy_core`.

**Rationale**:
- Keeps SRP boundaries cleaner: policy execution code does not manage storage descriptors.
- Removes string-key slot boilerplate from policy classes.
- Preserves strict typing + per-request isolation while keeping policy implementation friction low.

---

## Sentry Error Tracking: Opt-In with Two-Layer Scrubbing (2026-03-14, updated 2026-03-18)

**Decision**: Integrate Sentry with opt-in model (`SENTRY_ENABLED=false` by default, DSN from env var). Use two-layer data scrubbing: Sentry's built-in EventScrubber for credential key-name matching + custom `before_send` for selective LLM content redaction. The `luthien onboard` CLI prompts for Sentry setup and provides a default DSN.

**Rationale**:
- Opt-in respects user control — Sentry is configured during onboarding, not silently enabled
- DSN lives in `.env` (set by CLI onboard), not hardcoded in source
- Nuclear scrubbing (strip everything) was rejected: makes errors undebuggable. Selective scrubbing keeps `call_id`, `model`, `chunk_count`, request body keys while redacting LLM content values and credentials
- EventScrubber handles `api_key`/`token`/`auth` by key name. `before_send` handles LLM-specific vars (`body`, `messages`, `final_response`) that have generic names the scrubber can't match

**Alternatives rejected**:
- Server-side scrubbing only: credentials transit the network before scrubbing
- Strip all local variables: loses debugging context (`call_id`, `is_streaming`, `chunk_count`)

**Full details**: See `dev/context/sentry.md`

---

## Credential Type as Frozen Value Object (2026-04-02)

**Decision**: Introduce `Credential` (frozen dataclass) as the single type for credentials flowing through the system. `CredentialType` enum replaces ad-hoc `auth_type: Literal["api_key", "auth_token"]` strings and `is_bearer: bool` flags. Auth provider resolution is a tagged union (`UserCredentials | ServerKey | UserThenServer`) parsed from policy YAML config.

**Rationale**:
- Previous system had 5+ independent extraction/detection points using different heuristics (header parsing, string prefix checks, boolean flags)
- `Credential` carries type metadata alongside the value, so downstream code doesn't re-derive it
- Frozen dataclass enforces immutability — credential can't be accidentally mutated after extraction
- Auth providers decouple "where does the credential come from" (config concern) from "what is the credential" (runtime concern)

**Alternatives rejected**:
- Keeping raw strings + `is_bearer` flags: type information lost between layers, each consumer re-derives it
- Single `resolve()` method with string-based dispatch: loses type safety of the tagged union

---

## Allowlist (Not Blocklist) for Frontend-Exposed Request Params (2026-04-08)

**Decision**: Use an explicit allowlist (`_REQUEST_PARAM_ALLOWLIST`) when passing request parameters to the conversation viewer frontend, rather than excluding known-sensitive fields.

**Rationale**:
- A blocklist (`if k not in ("messages", "system")`) forwards every unknown field — any new field added to the request pipeline (by policies or the Anthropic API) is automatically leaked to the browser.
- An allowlist (`model`, `max_tokens`, `stream`, `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, `stop_sequences`, `output_config`) only passes explicitly approved fields.
- `output_config` is further sanitized to only include `format.type` (not the full JSON schema body, which may contain proprietary structure).

**Alternatives rejected**:
- Blocklist: grows stale the moment someone adds a field. A single `metadata: {api_key: "..."}` slip leaks credentials to the frontend.
- No params at all: frontend needs `max_tokens` and `output_config.format.type` for preflight classification.

---

## Structural Preflight Classification Over Content Heuristics (2026-04-08)

**Decision**: Classify non-conversational turns (quota probes, title generation) using structural request parameters, not response content.

**Approach**:
- Quota probe: `max_tokens === 1` (structural, catches all probes regardless of content)
- Title generation: `output_config.format.type === 'json_schema'` AND `max_tokens ≤ 256`

**Rationale**:
- Content heuristics (e.g., `response.length <= 2`, `startsWith('{"title"')`) are fragile and create false positives on short legitimate responses.
- `json_schema` alone is insufficient — real conversations can use structured output. The `max_tokens ≤ 256` guard prevents false positives.
- Position-based guards ("only classify early turns") were removed because Claude Code sends probes at any position in the session.

**Trade-off**: If Claude Code changes its probe structure (e.g., `max_tokens=2`), the classification silently stops working. The allowlisted `max_tokens` field in `request_params` makes this debuggable from the frontend.

---

## Upstream Header Injection Trust Model (2026-05-07)

**Decision**: `UPSTREAM_HEADERS` (PR #716) treats the operator and clients as trusted. The feature does not defend against:
- Hostile operators — they own the env, they can already do anything.
- Hostile clients — CRLF in `session_id` is malformed input, not an attack.
- "Exfiltration" of the operator's own secrets to a destination they configured.

**What is in scope**: input hygiene (CRLF/NUL stripping, RFC 7230 token validation, hop-by-hop blocklist). Failures fail loud at startup; misconfiguration cannot silently disable the integration.

**Explicitly rejected** (from PR #595's stack):
- **Sensitive-env-var blocklist** (`*KEY`, `*SECRET`, etc.). Paternalistic and breaks the canonical `HELICONE_API_KEY` use case.
- **`Authorization` / `X-Api-Key` blocklist**. Operator may legitimately want to override these on the way upstream (e.g., a proxy that uses standard `Authorization` instead of `Helicone-Auth`).

**Canonical reference**: `src/luthien_proxy/pipeline/upstream_headers.py` module docstring. Re-derive from there if the trust boundaries shift.

---

## session_summaries write is atomic with the canonical event write (2026-05-29)

**Decision**: `EventEmitter._write_db` (PR #780) wraps three statements in a
single `conn.transaction()`: the `conversation_calls` upsert, the
`conversation_events` insert, and the incremental `session_summaries` update. If
the summary update fails, the whole transaction rolls back — **including the
canonical `conversation_events` row**.

**Why drop the event rather than keep it**: a committed event with a failed
summary update permanently drifts the materialized `session_summaries` (the
migration-021 backfill uses `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING` / `INSERT OR IGNORE`, so it
won't repair an existing row). Drift is silent and hard to detect; a dropped
event is counted (`EventEmitter.dropped_db_writes`) and logged. We prefer a
visible, counted loss over silent inconsistency. `_write_db` is fire-and-forget
telemetry, so dropping an occasional event is acceptable; corrupting the
summary that the history page reads is not.

**Rejected alternative**: a SAVEPOINT around only the summary update (keeping the
event row even when the summary blows up). That preserves the event but
reintroduces exactly the drift we're avoiding, and adds complexity for a
fire-and-forget path. Not worth it.

**Consequence to remember**: if a `session_summary.py` regression ever makes the
summary update throw, *events for sessions will start disappearing*, not just
summaries. The dropped-writes counter is the signal. Both DB backends are
covered by the except clause (asyncpg errors + `sqlite3.Error`).

**Canonical reference**: `src/luthien_proxy/observability/emitter.py`
`_write_db`, and `observability/session_summary.py`.

---

## Request body event storage (2026-09-11)

**Decision**: Keep one raw request body in `pipeline.client_request.payload`
and one final request body in `transaction.request_recorded.final_request`.
`pipeline.backend_request` records only the final request's model, canonical
JSON SHA-256, and byte count. When policy processing leaves the request
unchanged, the transaction records the raw body's SHA-256 and its
`pipeline.client_request` reference instead of a second `original_request`;
when policy processing changes it, the original remains inline for the history
and debug diffs.

**Rationale**: A 127 KB request body was previously written four times:
`pipeline.client_request`, `pipeline.backend_request`, and the original and
final copies in `transaction.request_recorded`, for about 508 KB per request.
The raw event remains the audit record for what the client sent, and the final
transaction body remains the history reader's canonical request. The metadata
event keeps backend payload identity observable without another body copy.

**Scope**: HTTP request logging continues to store inbound and outbound request
bodies when `ENABLE_REQUEST_LOGGING` is enabled. It is a separately gated,
low-volume diagnostic surface and is outside this event-storage contract.

(Add new decisions as they're made with timestamps: YYYY-MM-DD)
